## 🎭 Yo, Welcome to the Bicycle Time Warp!

Strap on your helmets and prepare to pedal through the space-time continuum! **"Tick Tock, Pedal Clock"** isn't just a project, it's a groovy journey into the future of urban mobility. We're turning the chaotic world of hourly bike-sharing into a funky, well-oiled machine!

## 🕵️‍♀️ The Curious Case of the Hourly Bike Boogie

Picture this: You're the DJ of urban transportation, mixing tracks of supply and demand. Your mission? Drop the perfect beat of bikes across the city, hour by hour. It's not just prediction, it's a full-on time-traveling disco!

## 🔮 Our Hourly Hocus Pocus (Now with Extra Funk!)

We've conjured up a prediction model so hip, it could probably tell you how many bikes will be doing the Cha-Cha Slide in the next hour!

### What's Groovin' in Our Crystal Ball:
- 🧠 A neural network that boogies with hourly bike-sharing patterns
- 🔍 Algorithms that can spot a demand spike faster than you can say "Stayin' Alive"
- 💡 Insights so bright, you gotta wear shades 😎
